# Self-Made Test Case Generators
This repository contains all the Test-Case Generator Program that I have implemented in order to test and debug my [Projects](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Projects/).

# Motivation

Testing/Debugging is the most important part of any project or software phase. Thus I decided to create my own Test Case Generators in order to test and debug my [Projects](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Projects/).

# Languages/Technologies Used

All the Test Case Generators have been implemented in C/C++. 

# How to use these Test Case Generators ?

Just run your code on the sample test cases generated by these test-case generators. You must also run a correct brute-force solution in parallel with your own code to debug.
